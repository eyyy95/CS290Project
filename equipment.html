        <div class="itemText">My full-frame mirrorless camera I use for all my shoots. I love pretty much everything about this camera, from the image quality, dynamic range, autofocus capabilities, high FPS, dual card slots, excellent battery life, and versatility in many situations. Additionally, it's on the cheaper side of professional cameras, and is a great body for those considering the transition to full-frame or professional photography. </div>

      <li>Main Prime Lens</li>
        <div class="equipmentItems">Sony Zeiss Planar 50mm f/1.4 FE</div>

        <div class="itemText">This is my go to prime lens that I use for a lot of portrait shoots. The 50mm focal length is very versatile because it doesn't induce a lot of distortion, but also is wide enough to capture enough of the environment behind the subject. While this lens is pricey, it makes up for it in providing tack sharp images while allowing you to shoot at fast speeds or in low-light settings, as well as providing a lovely bokeh quality.</div>

      <li>Main Zoom Lens</li>
        <div class="equipmentItems">Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 FE</div>
        <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bcRnWD4lL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" style="width:30%">

        <div class="itemText">This has been my go to lens ever since I entered the full-frame world. This is the most versatile lens I've used; it's much lighter compared to other 24-70 2.8 lenses, but still provides a usable focal range, and allows fast shooting because of the f/2.8 max aperture. The wide end allows great landscape compositions, while the zoomed end is great for portrait work. This lens essentially functions like a native lens with fast autofocus and incredibly sharp image rendering. If I were to recommend one single lens for the Sony FE system, it would be this lens handsdown.</div>
