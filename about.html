      <p class="blockText">Hello there! My name is Edward, and I'm a postbaccalaureate student at Oregon State University and 
          a hobbyist portrait photographer. I got my start in photography in my first undergrad at UC Davis, with a D3200 DSLR, but the demands of college 
          life didn't allow me much time to pursue it at the time. After graduation, I got an A6000 mirrorless camera, and started bringing it
            me everywhere I went to squeeze in as much practice as possible. Eventually, I found myself most inspired by portraiture, and I was 
        always taking pictures of my family or friends, using whatever place we were at as our environmental backdrop. Eventually I upgraded to full-frame, 
        and now I almost exclusively take portrait photos. I am inspired by the diversity
        and raw emotion that the human face is capable of portraying, and the process of photography is fascinating because one can create beauty
        and art from seemingly mundane surroundings and situations. I love both candid and posed portrait photography, and am also starting to
        do more event-based portrait photography, such as college graduation/senior portraits for local college students. I am still a student and working another job full-time, but am always down
        collaborate with other individuals and create works of art for my portfolio! Please don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">reach out</a> if you're interested in working
        with me! I look forward to creating art with you!</p>
